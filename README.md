# APT3_TTP_Threat_Hunting
A TTP based threat hunting challenge/training for those looking to learn how to use knownledge of attacker TTPs to create hunts or detection analytics.

This work was inspired by the recent DEFCON 27 PHV workshop found here: https://github.com/RESOLVN/RTHVM

This VM contains a basic install of Hunting ELK (https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK) and the APT3 dataset (https://github.com/hunters-forge/mordor) both provided by Roberto Rodriguez.
